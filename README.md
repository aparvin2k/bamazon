CAL Extension Coding Bootcamp- Bamazon Inventory

 ```
Welcome to Bamazon! This is an Amazon-like storefront built with MySQL and Node.js. 

Within the customer portal, you can view the inventory and choose an item you'd like to purchase
along with the quantity. However, if we do not have enough of the selected item in stock deeming 
us unable to fulfill your purchase, the transaction will not go through.

Within the manager portal, you can view all inventory in the store, view all low
inventory (less than 10 items in stock), choose to add to the inventory, and even add new items to your inventory!
